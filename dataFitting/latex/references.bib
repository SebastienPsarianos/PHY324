abstract="The information needed when analysing data, for example, the cross-section measurements, is the 4-momentum vectors of particles in interest, and possibly the knowledge about species of the particles. For this purpose, the detector for the high energy physics is usually designed so that it allows us to measure the momentum or energy, and information for the particle identification, such as velocity. However, the recorded data as they are do not tell us anything. They are just a bunch of digits which are not energies or positions of particles if they are not properly translated into meaningful physical variables.",
